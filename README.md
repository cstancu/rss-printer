# RSS-to-Printer News Digest Script

- Randomly selects one news source from the FEED_SOURCES list each cycle.
- Fetches and parses the feed using [feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/).
- Generates a PDF formatted for easy reading on A4 paper (with date, title, and summary) using [reportlab](https://pypi.org/project/reportlab/).
- The printable output is strictly limited to a single A4 page per cycle.
- Prints the PDF to the network printer specified via `PRINTER_NAME`.
- Optionally deletes the generated PDF after printing to save disk space (controlled by `KEEP_PDF`).
- Runs the process repeatedly every `INTERVAL_MINUTES`; all configuration is at the top of the script.

## Requirements

- [`lpr`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lpr) command-line print tool (CUPS/Unix printing system)
- Python packages:
  - [feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/): Python library to parse RSS and Atom feeds  
  - [reportlab](https://pypi.org/project/reportlab/): Python library to generate PDFs from Python
  - Install with:
    ```
    pip install feedparser reportlab
    ```

## Usage

1. Edit `rss_to_printer.py` to set your feed sources, printer name, interval, and desired output PDF retention.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python3 rss_to_printer.py
   ```
3. The script will continuously fetch and print news in cycles, using PDF as print medium.

## Configuration

Adjust these variables at the top of `rss_to_printer.py` to suit your environment:
- `FEED_SOURCES`: List of (name, URL) news sources to randomly select from.
- `PRINTER_NAME`: The network printer name (from `lpstat -a` or system settings).
- `INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Printing interval (minutes) between each news digest.
- `KEEP_PDF`: Set to `False` to automatically delete PDFs after printing, saving disk space.

## Example Output

An example output PDF is included: [rss_printout_20250906_202440.pdf](rss_printout_20250906_202440.pdf)  
This file shows a typical single-page news digest generated by this script.
